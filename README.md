# 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game starts with two tiles marked "2" on a 4x4 grid. Players move tiles in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile that displays the sum of the two numbers. Each move also introduces a new tile labeled either "2" or "4" in a random empty spot on the grid. The game ends when there are no more moves left that can combine tiles. The simplicity of the gameplay, requiring strategic movement and foresight, has made 2048 highly popular and addictive.
